<h1>Multi Threaded Proxy Server with and without Cache</h1>

##### How did we implement Multi-threading?
- Used Semaphore instead of Condition Variables and pthread_join() and pthread_exit() function. 
- pthread_join() requires us to pass the thread id of the the thread to wait for. 
- Semaphore’s sem_wait() and sem_post() doesn’t need any parameter. So it is a better option. 


##### Need of Project
- To Understand → 
  - The working of requests from our local computer to the server.
  - The handling of multiple client requests from various clients.
  - Locking procedure for concurrency.
  - The concept of cache and its different functions that might be used by browsers.
- Proxy Server do → 
  - It speeds up the process and reduces the traffic on the server side.
  - It can be used to restrict user from accessing specific websites.
  - A good proxy will change the IP such that the server wouldn’t know about the client who sent the request.
  - Changes can be made in Proxy to encrypt the requests, to stop anyone accessing the request illegally from your client.
 
##### OS Component Used ​
- Threading
- Locks 
- Semaphore
- Cache (LRU algorithm is used in it)

##### Limitations ​
- If a URL opens multiple clients itself, then our cache will store each client’s response as a separate element in the linked list. So, during retrieval from the cache, only a chunk of response will be send and the website will not open
- Fixed size of cache element, so big websites may not be stored in cache.
